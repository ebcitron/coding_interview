Im going to need to use python to parse through the json.

    research syntax and variable assignment.

    figure out how to link the user_id to the name of the person

    look up ways python handles dates/times
        and if the problem is providing times they are available or already booked.

create a script to ...
    search for and return the open schedules of x names inputed
        for multiple people, do I only return times they are ALL available? 
        or should I return each inputted names availability, one after another?
        might as well also return an option where they are ALL available.


    take in names of who is being searched

    returns the times they are available


        refresh memory on working with dates/time in python(comparison, creating a "timesfree" from the inverse/negative of times they are booked)


    should I split each array up by day and the work hours?


    I think ill ....

    return each days availability


    so parse through and create a list of that employees appointments for the 5th, 6th, and 7th.

    merge overalapping intervals for multiple employee name inputs, find the remaining schedule free time and return per day

    start= 2021-07-05T13:00:00
    end = 2021-07-07T21:00:00
